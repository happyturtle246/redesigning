		<h1>Responsive Redesign: Revamping Toronto Cupcake's Webpage</h1>
		<p>Having lived in Toronto when I was younger, I am properly familiar with 
			the quality of the Toronto Cupcakes’ pastries. In fact, I immediately recognized 
			their name and logo as soon as I found their website. Thus, I chose to redesign 
			this page in an effort to lessen the gap between the quality of the bakery’s goods 
			and that of its web interface.
		</p>

		<p>Seen above is the home screen for <a href="https://torontocupcake.com/index.html">Toronto Cupcake's website</a>. A quick
			scroll also reveals some simple text welcoming the user and briefly describing the bakery before revealing bottom navigation
			menu containing all of the elements contained in the hamburger menu above.
		</p>

		<h2>Identifying Usability Problems: an Initial Look</h2>

		<table class="names">
			<tr>
				<th>UI Attribute</th>
				<th>Definition/Question</th> 
				<th>Findings</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Learnability</td>
				<td>How easily might users accomplish basic tasks upon their first encounter with the interface?</td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>The button to begin ordering online is not immediately obvious</li>
					<li>The website contains several interesting, up-to-date pages, but the buttons 
						to navigate to them are relatively hidden (bottom of the page with the same text as the body)</li>
					<li>A pixelated image (which does not even properly display the cupcakes) takes up most of the initial 
						screen, making a user’s next navigation steps unclear</li>
				</ul></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Memorability</td>
				<td>How easily might users reestablish proficiency with the interface when returning to it after some period of time without using it?</td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>The Cart page lacks photos for clarity, which could create confusion after a while without using the interface</li>
				</ul></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Efficiency</td>
				<td>How quickly might users be able to perform tasks once they’ve learned the interface?</td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>Assuming proficiency, a user would be able to interact with the interface decently, though it is still visually clunky and unformatted</li>
				</ul></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h2>Evaluating Accessibility</h2>

			<p>The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool is helpful for understanding the accessibility 
				of web content—a crucial consideration when it comes to analyzing the strengths and faults of 
				any interface. The following are some of the findings: </p>

				<ul class="a">
					<li>After running Toronto Cupcakes’ website through the tool, <b>8 cases of alternative text</b> 
						were found, which appears to be positive at first, but a closer look reveals that the 
						website’s use of alt text is undetailed and thus relatively unhelpful (e.g. “Toronto Cupcake 
						logo” as opposed to a description of the logo).</li>
					<li><b>2 redundant links</b> were identified, as well as a <b>device-dependent event handler</b>, 
						referring to the hamburger menu in the upper left-hand corner.</li>
					<li>However, the tool also identified <b>0 contrast errors</b>, which makes the site well suited for 
						the visually imapaired.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>The Redesign: Low Fidelity Wireframing</h2>

				<p>To begin the redesigning process, I created three lo-fi wireframes (desktop, mobile, and tablet), establishing
					the elemental layout of the new webpage and annotating the ways in which it will solve the problems identified in the original home page. 
				</p>

				<h2>Hi-Fi Prep</h2>

			<p>Before created the high-fidelity wireframes with which I would guide the implementation of the revamped
				webpage, I organized my ideas into a <b>visual design style guide</b>, as seen below:
			</p>

			<h2>High Fidelity Prototyping & the Final Product</h2>

			<p>Using all of the findings and ideas listed above, I ultimately designed <b>three high fidelity prototypes</b> 
				(for three screen sizes) and a <a href="https://happyturtle246.github.io/cupcakes/">final webpage</a> for the home screen of Toronto Cupcake.
